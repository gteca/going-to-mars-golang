# Ticket to Mars Website

Welcome to the Ticket to Mars website, a fictitious platform that allows users to purchase tickets for a journey to Mars. This project combines a web server for user interaction and a gRPC client that communicates with a separate gRPC server to validate ticket purchase requests.

## Getting Started

To run the Ticket to Mars website locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your machine
- - **protoc** for protobuf compilation (Maybe not needed). To compile protobuf, run:
```bash
$ cd payment
$ protoc --go_out=paths=source_relative:. --go-grpc_out=paths=source_relative:. payment.proto
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gteca/ticket-to-mars-website.git
   cd ticket-to-mars-website
   ```

2. Install the Go dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the gRPC server (Follow the instructions at [api-and-grpc-server-in-golang](https://github.com/gteca/api-and-grpc-server-in-golang) to run the gRPC server).

2. Start the web server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The Ticket to Mars website will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080/mars](http://localhost:8000/mars).

## Features

- **User Information Form**: Users can input their name, email, ticket quantity, date, and credit card number.

- **gRPC Client Integration**: The web server acts as a gRPC client and communicates with the gRPC server to validate ticket purchase requests.

- **Ticket Validation**: Ticket purchase depends on the response from the gRPC server, which validates the user's request.
